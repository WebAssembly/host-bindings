# A suite of adapter scenarios

This suite of examples is intended to demonstrate a spanning set of examples and
transformations that permit the use of interface types to specify imports and
exports.

## Notes
Added let, func.bind, env.get, field.get, string.copy, create instructions.

Changed arg.get to local.get because it is clearer when combined with let.
